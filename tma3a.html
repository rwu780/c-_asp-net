                    The original description and requirements of part1 is to design a web application that uses a persistent cookie to track how many
                    times a client computer has visited the page.<br />
                    And at the mean time, the web should also show the time zone of where the client located and its IP address
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Require 3 label, one to display the cookie count, one for IP address and one for the timzone
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the cookie: If the cookie do not exist, create a cookie and add to response; If the cookie exists, load the count from cookie
                        and add one, then delete old cookie and create a new cookie and store the value and add to response
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the IP address: retrieve a list of IP address associated with the current lost and find the IP that used for inter network

                <h2>Part2</h2>

                <h3>Original Description and requirements of the project:</h3>
                <p>
                    The requirement for part2 is to develope a web application using ASP.NET in C# that runs a slideshow of a list of pictures.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Information about the pic must be stored either in a database or in a text file. The information should contain
                            the name, locatoin of each picture
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The caption should be shown under each picture
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A button to start/stop the show
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Control to toggle the show between random and sequential
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            buttons manually turn the show backward or forward
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At least 20 pictures
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Interpretation, Analysis and Design</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Require 1 image to display the image, 1 label to display the caption, 1 script manager, 1 timer, 4 fieldsets:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first fieldset contain a button that will control the start/stop action</li>
                            <li>The second fieldset contains control forward/backward movement for the show</li>
                            <li>The third fieldset contain control toggle for random/sequential movement for the show</li>
                            <li>The last fieldset contain two button, manually for next/previous image</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The name, location and caption for the iamges will be stored inside picArray.txt. The program will read the file, and retrieve the url, caption based on index of the current image.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since the web page reload after button click or image refresh, thus need to use ViewState to store values that need to be retained during postback
                        There will be 4 fields need to stop inside ViewSate:
                        <ul>
                            <li>current: current index of the image</li>
                            <li>startStop: current state for start/stop </li>
                            <li>movement: current state for forward/backward</li>
                            <li>sequence: current state for random/sequential</li>
                        </ul>

                        Every time a toggle or button was clicked, it will update the value inside ViewSate.
                        Thus the next image will change correspond to the 4 values inside ViewState
                    </p>
